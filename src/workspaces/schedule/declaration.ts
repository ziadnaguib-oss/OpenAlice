/**
 * Schedule snapshot machinery — the read-only view GET /api/schedule returns,
 * built from a workspace's SCHEDULED issues.
 *
 * The data model itself now lives in `../issues/declaration.ts`: each workspace
 * declares issues as one markdown file per issue under `.alice/issues/`. An issue
 * that carries a `when` self-schedules exactly like the old schedule task; an
 * issue without `when` is a pure board work item and never reaches this layer.
 * This module is just the scheduling projection of those scheduled issues — it
 * pairs each one's `when` with the scanner's last-fired marker and the computed
 * next-due, so the dashboard matches real firing behavior.
 *
 * The issue reader (`readWorkspaceIssues`) is re-exported here so the scanner and
 * the route layer can import everything scheduling-related from one place.
